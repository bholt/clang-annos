EnerC Type Checker
==================

This directory contains a Clang plugin (which only works with the accompanying
Clang, which is augmented with logic supporting type qualifiers) that performs
EnerC type checking. When the plugin is included, EnerC invariants are checked
in annotated C/C++ code and propagated to the resulting LLVM bitcode.

To build the plugin:
  
    cd EnerCTypeChecker
    make

Then, to check/compile EnerC code:

    ./bin/enerclang foo.c

(The `enerclang` program behaves just like `clang` but adds the EnerC plugin.)
To run some test compilations:

    ./test/runtests.sh

Note that the EnerCTypeChecker directory (messily) contains both generic
extensible type qualifier checking support and EnerC-specific logic. These
should eventually be decoupled.
